1. since c works in virtual memory address rather then physical, Mystery_t should be uintptr_t
2.  entry 1023 ---  Page table for top 4MB of physical memory(assume 4mb has of physical memory after it)
    entry 1022 ---  pae table for second top 4 MB 
    entry 2         page table for the third lowest 4MB
    entry 1         page table with the second lowest 4MB
    entry 0         page table for lowest 4MB
3. we made sure that the permissions for user to have access were not set to true
4. We only are working with a single layed page table process, we have a 32 bit system and we need 4 bytes for the link and 4 for the refrence
    due to that we have to divide our memory by the amount of pages 4096 *1024 or 4MB 4MB/8B=512 KB since each page is also 4KB  max is 2GB
5.  We use all of the 4MB for page info and page table will be 4KB since we have at most 1KB of memory in page table entries and each is 4 bytes
so we get 4MB +2MB +4K= 6MB +2KB in needed overhead 

6. After we set CR3, the addres of EIP is still low.
It gets reset to high once we jmp which allows virtual address page translation
